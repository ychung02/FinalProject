- FinalProject will be my personal website, which presents “creative documentation” of my ideas.
- While taking a digital media class, The mind in hand, I was required to make “creative documentation” of all the works I made in the class.
- Through this experiment, I recognize that I often used my old, and personal feelings or ideas to make a work.
- Which means they are all connected and inspired to each other somehow; it’s a continuous process of revisiting memories
- Therefore, the website would be a mixture of my personal notes: including diaries to notes about inspirational artists and their work; plus my own portfolio. 
- The logo will be the key to move between my works and my more personal page. 

##This is the past "creative documentation" project.

#Details
1.  Tools I’ve used: (1)Sublime Text: they shows suggestion of codes and made the process easier and faster (2)jqueryui(3)stack overflow(4)jsBin to generate smaller testings before I type in to Sublime — so the process was mostly done in order of jsBin to Sublime to Github. And I also love how github preserves the history I’ve done, because it’s such an easy thing to just trash what I did before in this kind of medium.
2.  I almost exactly did what I was expecting to make, from these little squares to hectic atmosphere. After getting some feedbacks, I’ve realized that it might not be so proper as my official portfolio website, but since I like the weird appearance it has now, I would probably keep work on it and refine it to have better system. 
3.  Not only description, I spent some time putting pieces of my notes and referenced artist, or whatever that contributed to my work. The whole process required me to revisit the note I made before, in order to make that specific work. 
4.  Therefore, every time I go over this website, again, is the revisiting not only my work itself but the process of it. It allows me to go over where did I start, and what influenced me to the conclusion. It’s why I said this website is not only for others, but also for myself.
5.  Although I kind of avoided to make a huge change from my original intention, I try to get many feedbacks from people, because I was curious of their reaction. From that I made some little refinement or addition of things (PDF or up button). But I got the most help from Chihao.

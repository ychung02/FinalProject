Final Project- Compose a draft of FinalProject proposal in README.md of your FinalProject repo on GitHub. 

- FinalProject will be my personal website, which presents “creative documentation” of my ideas.
- While taking one of the digital media class during wintersession, I was required to make “creative documentation” of all the works I made in the class.
- Through this experiment, I recognize that I often used my old, and personal feelings or ideas to make a work.
- Which means they are all connected and inspired to each other somehow; it’s a continuous process of revisiting memories
- Therefore, the website would be a mixture of my personal notes: including diaries to notes about inspirational artists and their work; plus my own portfolio. 
- The initial view of the website will include both of those sections, while it’s possible to separate them if the view wants to. 

##This is the past "creative documentation" project.
